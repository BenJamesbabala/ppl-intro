Probabilistic Programming for Programming Languages People
==========================================================

This is an introduction to [probabilistic programming][ppl] for people from across the broad spectrum of backgrounds at the workshop, so it starts with the absolute basics.
In particular, I find that most introductions to PPL are written for and by machine-learning and statistics experts.
(Here's [an exception][ple-ppl] from Michael Hicks at [the *Programming Languages Enthusiast* blog][ple].)
I'm a programming-languages person, so these notes start from the opposite perspective.

The notes originated as an overview lecture at [the November, 2015 Dagstuhl seminar on approximate and probabilistic computing][dagstuhl].
